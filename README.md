# Hobbit-Language-Model
MakeHobbits is a word level language model created using PyTorch and inspired by Andrej Karpathy's makemore. Its initial training was done using
J.R.R Tolkien's The Hobbit hence the name MakeHobbits. The model is currently a very basic attempt at an MLP but the plan is transformers and beyond.
It is fed text and will in time be able to use that text to create new sentences.

This model's current implementation is inspired by these sources
  * makemore Andrej Karpathy 2022
  * MLP, following Bengio et al. 2003

# Usage
Any English text file can be used in place of Hobbits.txt so long as it contains distince sentences.
